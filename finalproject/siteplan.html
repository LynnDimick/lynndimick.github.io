          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>I am a licensed NRA gun safety instructor. I am licensed to teach Concealed Carry Weapons classes for the state of Utah. <br><br>
            I have a current web site, https://www.gunsafetyacademy.com/
            Hosted on wix.com. It has a lot of limitations because of the rigidity of their templates and the extra costs of adding on features.
            <br>
            <br>I would like to create a website that provides better layout and color options, a better calendar, and a better way of sharing information via a blog. 
            <br>
            <br>I want to create a web site that people come to, not to sell them anything, but as a place where they can find answers to their questions about gun safety or the CCW experience. This website will be used as a marketing site for my training business, an informaiton portal for informationt that impacts gun owners, safety and training.<br>
            <br>
            <br>This site is intended to answer gewneral quesitons about carrying a concealed weapon, a place to learn about gun safety,  a source for infromational links,<br>
            and a place for new or inexperienced gun owners to ask questions. I do not want to make it a site with a Rambo mentality.
            
            
            </p>
          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>My target audience are adults who may want to learn more about the concealed carry application process in the state of Utah. Also people who are concerned about their own gun safety knowledge, safe handling, and skills. </p>
          <br>This site is intended to answer questions about carrying a concealed weapon, a place to learn about gun safety,  a source for infromational links,<br>
          and a place for new or inexperienced gun owners to ask questions. I do not want to make it a site with a Rambo mentality.
